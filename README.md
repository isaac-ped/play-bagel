# Play Bagel!

Bagel is a two player word game!

Players alternate guessing each-other's secret 5-letter word.
For each guess, they are told the number of overlapping
letters between their guess and the secret.

To play a local match against the computer:
```shell
python bagel.py
```

There is also a node.js site, ready and waiting to be hosted somewhere
(which is currently not online).
